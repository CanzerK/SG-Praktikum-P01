With a bit of ingenuity and teamwork, the Darmsville Construction Yard is back in order! The construction workers, with some creative ideas from the townspeople, manage to safely clear the fallen materials. The kids cheer as they see the workers high-five each other, proud of their hard work. The construction site is once again buzzing with activity, and it's a great day in Darmsville, showing what can be achieved when a community works together.
